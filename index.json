However, this task can be complex in highly dynamic environments with various resources to allocate for an increasing number of different users requirements. In this work, we propose a Cloud architecture based on a multi-agent system exhibiting a self-adaptive behavior to address the dynamic resource allocation. This self-adaptive system follows a MAPE-K approach to reason and act, according to QoS, Cloud service information, and propagated run-time information, to detect QoS degradation and make better resource allocation de- cisions. We validate our proposed Cloud architecture by simulation. Results show that it can properly allocate resources to reduce energy consumption, while satisfying the users demanded QoS.","tags":[],"title":"A Self-adaptive Agent-based System for Cloud Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zakaria Maamar","Noura Faci","Khouloud Boukadi","Emir Ugljanin","Mohamed Sellami","Thar Baker","Rafael Angarita"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552129207,"objectID":"61247424e353413bd307c2449b9562c4","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/18_rcis/","publishdate":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18_rcis/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the smooth weaving of the Internet-of- Things into people’s daily lives, many challenges, such as diversity and multiplicity of things’ development technologies and commu- nication standards, and users’ reluctance due to privacy invasion, are slowing down this weaving. This paper tackles the challenge of things’ passive nature that has confined them into a data-supplier role. Empowering things with additional capabilities would make them proactive so, that, they can for instance, reach out to peers exposing collaborative attitude and (un)form dynamic communities when necessary. In this paper, this empowerment takes shape through thing agentification that relies on norms (specialized into business and social) to regulate the operations of things and commitments to ensure thing compliance with these norms. No-compliance would lead to sanctions over things, which should affect their credibility and reputation. A proof-of- concept and missing-child case study technically illustrate thing agentification.","tags":[],"title":"How to Agentify the Internet-of-Things?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Patrick Wang","Rafael Angarita","Ilaria Renna"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552129207,"objectID":"b93c272c9f0e664ee94d4d423c1ed51a","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/18_blackmirror/","publishdate":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18_blackmirror/","section":"publication","summary":"Social media is an amazing platform for enhancing public expo- sure.

At the same time, the aggressive market competition has led to the emergence of multiple competing siloed OSNSs that cannot interoperate. As a consequence, people face the burden of creating and managing multiple OSNS accounts and learning how to use them to stay connected. This paper is concerned with relieving users from such a burden by enabling universal online social interactions. The contributions of this paper span: (1) a model of the universal social network bus (USNB) for OSNS interoperability; (2) a prototype for universal online social interactions that builds upon the proposed model; and (3) a preliminary experimental evaluation involving 50 participants. Results show that people are positive about the solution as they are able to reach out a larger community of users independently of the OSNSs they use.","tags":[],"title":"USNB: Enabling Universal Online Social Interactions (Best Paper Award)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael Angarita","Nikolaos Georgantas","Cristhian Parra","James Holston","Valérie Issarny"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552129207,"objectID":"1747afc6964d8757bd521c5a8c40a306","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/17_icse/","publishdate":"2017-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/17_icse/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer-mediated communication can be defined as any form of human communication achieved through computer technology. From its beginnings, it has been shaping the way humans interact with each other, and it has influenced many areas of society. There exist a plethora of communication services enabling computer-mediated social communication (e.g., Skype, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, WhatsApp, Twitter, Slack, etc.). Based on personal preferences, users may prefer a communication service rather than another. As a result, users sharing same interests may not be able to interact since they are using incompatible technologies. To tackle this interoperability barrier, we propose the Social Communication Bus, a middleware solution targeted to enable the interaction between heterogeneous communication services. More precisely, the contribution of this paper is threefold: (i), we propose a survey of the various forms of computer-mediated social communication, and we make an analogy with the computing communication paradigms; (ii), we revisit the eXtensible Service Bus (XSB) that supports interoperability across computing interaction paradigms to provide a solution for computer-mediated social communication interoperability; and (iii), we present Social-MQ, an implementation of the Social Communication Bus that has been integrated into the AppCivist platform for participatory democracy.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging the service bus paradigm for computer-mediated social communication interoperability","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552129207,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
