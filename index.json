However, engaging a sufficiently large number of citizens, as well as collecting adequate contributions, require special attention in the functionalities implemented by the platform. This paper empirically analyzes the existing flaws in participatory platforms and their impact on citizen participation. We focus specifically on the citizen consultation ``République Numérique'' (Digital Republic) to identify issues arising from the interactions between users on the supporting platform. We chose this consultation because of the high number of contributors and contributions, and the various means of interaction it proposes. Through an analysis of the available data, we highlight that contributions tend to be concentrated around a small set of proposals and contributors. This leads us to formulate a number of recommendations for the design of participatory platforms regarding the management of contributions, from their organization to their presentation to users.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting Obstacles to Collaboration in an Online Participatory Democracy Platform: A Use-case Driven Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shufan Jiang","Rafael Angarita","Raja Chiky","Stéphane Cormier","Francis Rousseaux","Julian Oresanz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646234598,"objectID":"75028ac96cd4ce65451ba2adafe27eb1","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/22_egc/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22_egc/","section":"publication","summary":"Data mining in social media has been widely applied in different domains for monitoring and measuring social phenomena, such as opinion analysis towards popular events, sentiment analysis of a population, detecting early side effects of drugs and earthquake detection.

Facing to newly forming technical lock-ins and the loss of local knowledge in agriculture in the era of plain digital transformation, the urge of re-establish a farmer-centric precision agriculture is evident.

Such data contains already latent historical knowledge in the domain. This knowledge enables us to precisely study natural hazards within global or local aspects, and then improve the risk prevention tasks and augment the yield, which helps to tackle the challenge of growing population and changing alimentary habits. In particular, French Plants Health Bulletins (BSV, for its name in French Bulletin de Santé du Végétal) give information about the development stages of phytosanitary risks in agricultural production. However, they are written in natural language, thus,  machines and human cannot exploit them as efficiently as it could be. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies aim to automatically process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Since the 2010s, with the increases in computational power and parallelization, representation learning and deep learning methods became widespread in NLP. Recent advancements Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) inspire us to rethink of knowledge representation and natural language understanding in plant health management domain. The goal in this work is to propose a BERT-based approach to automatically classify the BSV to make their data easily indexable. We sampled 200 BSV to finetune the pretrained BERT language models and classify them as pest or/and disease and we show preliminary results.","tags":[],"title":"Fine-tuning BERT-based models for Plant Health Bulletin Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shufan Jiang","Rafael Angarita","Raja Chiky","Stéphane Cormier","Francis Rousseaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610496000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639573245,"objectID":"36c46665264c24e5935651c8a2432677","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/21_egc_poster/","publishdate":"2021-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/21_egc_poster/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Vers la Reconstruction des Connaissances Agricoles : Perspectives de Détection des Risques Naturels à partir de Sources de Données Hétérogènes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grigorios Piperagkas","Rafael Angarita","Valérie Issarny"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611750260,"objectID":"c321bc56ed75c6dedb06f4e35396c95f","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/20_isesl_social/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20_isesl_social/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital technologies have impacted almost every aspect of our society, including how people participate in activities that matter to them. Indeed, digital participation allows people to be involved in different societal activities at an unprecedented scale through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Still, enabling participation at scale requires making it seamless for people to: interact with a variety of software platforms, get information from connected physical objects and software services, and communicate and collaborate with their peers. Toward this objective, this paper introduces and formalizes the concept of Social Participation Network, which captures the diverse participation relationships –between people, digital services and connected things– supporting participatory processes. The paper further presents the design of an associated online service to support the creation and management of Social Participation Networks. The design advocates the instantiation of Social Participation Networks within distinct participation contexts — spanning, e.g., private institutions, neighbor communities, and governmental institutions— so that the participants' information and contributions to participation remain isolated and private within the given context.","tags":[],"title":"Social Participation Network: Linking things, services and people to support participatory processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shufan Jiang","Rafael Angarita","Raja Chiky","Stéphane Cormier","Francis Rousseaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646234598,"objectID":"716b09b95ee480ac6f1750c9f851921f","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/20_isesl_agro/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20_isesl_agro/","section":"publication","summary":"Sustainable agriculture is crucial to society since it aims at supporting the world’s current food needs without compromising future generations.

These data coming from different types of IoT devices can also be combined with relevant information published in online social networks and on the Web in the form of textual documents. Our objective is to integrate such heterogeneous data into knowledge bases that can support farmers in their activities, and to present global, real-time and comprehensive information to researchers. This will also help to relate agricultural data to contexts such as ecological and financial contexts.

Current civic technologies are traditional Web- or mobile-based platforms that make difficult, or just impossible, the participation of citizens via different communication technologies. Moreover, connected objects sensing physical-world data can nourish participatory processes by providing physical evidence to citizens; however, leveraging these data is not direct and still a time-consuming process for civic technologies developers. This paper introduces the concept of social middleware for civic engagement. Social middleware allows citizens to engage in participatory processes -supported by civic technologies- via their favorite communication tools, and to interact not only with other citizens but also with relevant connected objects and software platforms. The mission of social middleware goes beyond the connection of all these heterogeneous entities. It aims at easing the implementation of distributed applications oriented toward civic engagement by featuring dedicated built-in services.","tags":[],"title":"Social Middleware for Civic Engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael Angarita","Bruno Lefèvre","Shohreh Ahvar","Ehsan Ehvar","Nikolaos Georgantas","Valérie Issarny"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611750260,"objectID":"a530e7daa95f50f68b8d7c0e714494a4","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/19_cryblock/","publishdate":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/19_cryblock/","section":"publication","summary":"Online Social Network Services (OSNSs) are changing the fabric of our society, impacting almost every aspect of it. Over the last decades, the aggressive market rivalry has led to the emergence of multiple competing, 'closed' OSNSs. As a result, users are trapped in the walled gardens of their OSNS, encountering restrictions about what they can do with their personal data, the people they can interact with and the information they get access to. As an alternative to the platform lock-in, 'open' OSNSs promote the adoption of open, standardized APIs. However, users still massively adopt closed OSNSs to benefit from the services' advanced functionalities and/or follow their 'friends', although the users' virtual social sphere is ultimately limited by the OSNSs they join. Our work aims at overcoming such a limitation by enabling users to meet and interact beyond the boundary of their OSNSs, including reaching out to 'friends' of distinct closed OSNSs. We specifically introduce USNB-Universal Social Network Bus, which revisits the 'service bus' paradigm that enables interoperability across computing systems, to address the requirements of 'social interoperability'. USNB features synthetic profiles and personae for interaction across the boundaries of-closed and open- ,-profile-and non-profile-based-OSNSs through a reference social interaction service. We ran a 1-day workshop with a panel of users who experimented with the USNB prototype to assess the potential benefits of social interoperability for social network users. Results show the positive evaluation of users for USNB, especially as an enabler of applications for civic participation. This further opens up new perspectives for future work, among which, enforcing security and privacy guarantees.","tags":[],"title":"Universal Social Network Bus: Towards the Federation of Heterogeneous Online Social Network Services ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael Angarita","Alexandre Dejous","Patrick Blake"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611750260,"objectID":"4540f38f11905008ec2102d038c8b306","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/19_toit/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/19_toit/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last years, lighting only accounted for more than 15% of global electricity consumption. Moreover, we expect a high increase of energy consumption in the next years due to the large growth in lighting and appliances usage in developing economies. As the United Nations Secretary-Generals Sustainable Energy for All initiative identified, there exists a high potential of reducing the world's greenhouse gas emissions by improving the energy efficiency of lighting and appliances. For that, we have developed in the past a 'centralized' product registration system to allow suppliers, manufactures, or traders to register their products to enter into a market. This product registration system is a crucial tool for identifying non-compliant, inefficient products. It serves as an entry-point for testers and regulators to examine the energy efficiency of the registered products, verify if they satisfy the minimum standards, and decide to let them enter into their markets. Our product registration system, as well as any other centralized implementation, suffers from isolated data storage hindering the collaboration between different markets from both governance and technical perspectives. In this paper , we examine the limits of centralized product registration systems and the advantages of a decentralized model based on the blockchain. Our analysis and prototype suggest that a blockchain-based product registration system can help to reduce the barriers between markets and play an important role in the quest for energy efficiency.","tags":[],"title":"From centralized to decentralized blockchain-based product registration systems: the use case of lighting and appliances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Merzoug Soltane","Yudith Cardinale","Rafael Angarita","Philippe Rosse","Marta Rukoz","Derdour Makhlouf","Kazar Okba"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528934400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611750260,"objectID":"af0c4d2fdc27a24ab6011791f04bab14","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/publication/18_selfadapt/","publishdate":"2018-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18_selfadapt/","section":"publication","summary":"Cloud computing is a model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of com- puting resources, that can be dynamically allocated and released with minimal effort.

From its beginnings, it has been shaping the way humans interact with each other, and it has influenced many areas of society. There exist a plethora of communication services enabling computer-mediated social communication (e.g., Skype, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, WhatsApp, Twitter, Slack, etc.). Based on personal preferences, users may prefer a communication service rather than another. As a result, users sharing same interests may not be able to interact since they are using incompatible technologies. To tackle this interoperability barrier, we propose the Social Communication Bus, a middleware solution targeted to enable the interaction between heterogeneous communication services. More precisely, the contribution of this paper is threefold: (i), we propose a survey of the various forms of computer-mediated social communication, and we make an analogy with the computing communication paradigms; (ii), we revisit the eXtensible Service Bus (XSB) that supports interoperability across computing interaction paradigms to provide a solution for computer-mediated social communication interoperability; and (iii), we present Social-MQ, an implementation of the Social Communication Bus that has been integrated into the AppCivist platform for participatory democracy.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging the service bus paradigm for computer-mediated social communication interoperability","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611750260,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://rafaelangarita.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
